# morsecode_interpreter

A simple morsecode translator that works in command line. The script determines automatically if the input is a plaintext that needs to be encoded or vice-versa.

## USAGE
* To encode plaintext to morsecode or vice-versa type: 
```
 python3 morsecode_interpreter.py 
```
* Type "exit" to return to command line

<b>NOTE:</b> The morsecode format uses single space as letter delimiter and double space as word delimiter.
